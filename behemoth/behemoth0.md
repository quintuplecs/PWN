# behemoth0
slopey112 - 2/25/19

Alright, let's take a look at some of the games at OverTheWire. The behemoth series seems to be the first set of PWNing challenges.

Not going to lie, it took me a while to figure out where the actual level was when I entered the machine. Turns out you have to `cd /behemoth`.

Anyways, when we get there, seems like there's a list of binaries, and amongst them, is `behemoth0`.

Calling it, it seems like it's a typical password authentication script.
```
behemoth0@behemoth:/behemoth$ ./behemoth0
Password: asdf
Access denied..
```
Seems like `asdf` isn't the password. Ok. Since it's the first level, why not just call `strings` and see if we're lucky?
```

```
Amongst the list of strings, three stand out in particular. Is this challenge really that simple? After trying all three, it seems like `strings` was a trap; neither of the three work. Seems like we're just going to have to open up our trusty GDB.

Above is the assembly dump of main. Something stands out in this code, however, and it's the call to `memfrob`. Is that a user defined function, or is it a library function? Turns out it's the latter.
```
DESCRIPTION
       The  memfrob() function encrypts the first n bytes of the memory area s
       by exclusive-ORing each character with the number 42.  The  effect  can
       be reversed by using memfrob() on the encrypted memory area.

       Note  that  this function is not a proper encryption routine as the XOR
       constant is fixed, and is suitable only for hiding strings.
```
It's a simple XOR cipher. This explains why we couldn't see the password earlier; It was encrypted by `memfrob()`. However, if we carefully look at the code, this doesn't have to be a cryptography problem.
```
...
0x0804860d <+92>:	lea    eax,[ebp-0x1c]
0x08048610 <+95>:	push   eax
0x08048611 <+96>:	call   0x804858b <memfrob>
0x08048616 <+101>:	add    esp,0x8
0x08048619 <+104>:	lea    eax,[ebp-0x1c]
0x0804861c <+107>:	push   eax
0x0804861d <+108>:	lea    eax,[ebp-0x5d]
0x08048620 <+111>:	push   eax
0x08048621 <+112>:	call   0x80483f0 <strcmp@plt>
...
```
Note these lines in particular. Let's work out what this does. Ok, so first, we push the memory at `[ebp-0x1c]` and pushes it on the stack. Since `memfrob` is called immediately after, this must be the parameter of the function!

Because we know `strcmp` is called after `memfrob`, the only logical explanation is that `memfrob` is used to decrypt the hidden password. So this means if we just look at `[ebp-0x1c]` after `memfrob` has been called, we should get our answer; `[ebp-0x5d]` should be the second argument to `strcmp`, which in this case is our input.
```

```
Let's take a look at the first four items on the stack here, starting at address `0xffffd6ac`. When we convert these all to human-readable text, we get `mtae`, `ohsy`, then `str`. Flipping each of these around (since the machine is little-endian), we get the string `eatmyshorts`.

Let's test this in GDB.
```
(gdb) r

Access granted. We'll try cracking this for real now.
```
behemoth0@behemoth:/behemoth$ ./behemoth0
Password: eatmyshorts
Access granted..
$ cd /etc/behemoth_pass
$ ls
behemoth0  behemoth1  behemoth2  behemoth3  behemoth4  behemoth5  behemoth6  behemoth7	behemoth8
$ cat behemoth1
aesebootiv
```
And we get the password.
